# i followed this link  https://docs.adyen.com/payment-methods/cards/custom-card-integration/?tab=web_1

here i have implemented "Custom card integration in adyen"   using html and plain javascript only.

# open vscode , click on index3.html , open with vscode live server extension


since there is a cors issue with ajax, disable it using below cmd
# for linux open terminal and enter:   google-chrome --disable-site-isolation-trials --disable-web-security --user-data-dir="~/tmp"


and use the opened browser to make payment

enjoy !!
